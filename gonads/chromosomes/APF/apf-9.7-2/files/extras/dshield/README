Running the provided install script will setup the dshield client to parse APF
iptable logs daily and submit a summary report to dshield.org for inclusion
into global attack trends. This feature is directly related to the dsheild drop
list as such list is possible by providing the dshield.org site with live world
firewall event logs.

Simply execute the install script and a preconfigured setup of dshield's python
client will be installed; as well, a cronjob will be placed in:
/etc/cron.daily/ds
